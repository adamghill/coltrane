# Introduction

`coltrane` is a [**Dynamic Site Generator**](index.md#-what-is-a-dynamic-site-generator). It can be used as a self-contained app for content sites, as a third-party app in a `Django` project to render `markdown` files, or to build a static HTML website.

## ‚≠ê Features

- Render `markdown` files as HTML with automatic URL routing based on the filesystem
- Local development server with live re-rendering of markdown and data
- Use JSON files as a data source
- Automatic generation of `sitemap.xml` and `rss.xml`
- Can also serve non-markdown files, e.g. `robots.txt`
- Deployment best practices with `Docker`, `whitenoise`, and `gunicorn` already pre-configured
- Leverage built-in or custom `Django` template tags and filters
- Include any third-party [`Django` app](https://djangopackages.org) for additional functionality
- Optional building of static HTML files

## üôã What is a Dynamic Site Generator?

`coltrane` is similar to a static site generator -- it takes `markdown` content and renders it as HTML. However, it also provides an opinionated framework for building dynamic websites.

### Examples in the wild

- [python-utils](https://adamghill.com/python-utils): Interactive Python playground (uses `django-unicorn` component library)
- [unsuckjs.com](https://unsuckjs.com): Libraries to progressively enhance HTML with minimal amounts of JavaScript (uses GitHub REST API)
- [djangobrew.com](https://djangobrew.com): Website for the Django Brew podcast (uses the Buzzsprout API)

## üéµ What's with the name?

`coltrane` is built on top of the `Django` web framework, which is named after [Django Reinhardt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_Reinhardt). This framework is named after [John Coltrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Coltrane), another (more avant-garde üé∂) jazz musician.
