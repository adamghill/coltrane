# Context

The template context for each `markdown` file includes:

- all key/value pairs in the `markdown` frontmatter
- rendered `markdown` HTML in `content`
- JSON data from the `data` directory
- `now` which provides the current `datetime` (would be the time of HTML rendering for when generating a static site)
- `request` which provides the current request
- `debug` which contains the `DEBUG` setting (or if `INTERNAL_IPS` has the current request's IP)
- `slug` which contains the current file's "slug" (e.g. `articles/some-new-article` if there was a markdown file at `content/articles/some-new-article.md`)
- `toc` which is an automatically generated table of contents rendered as HTML
- if `publish_date` is found, it is converted to a Python `datetime` instance using the excellent [dateparser](https://dateparser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library
